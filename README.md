## **GRADING POLICY (MAY BE ADJUSTED):**

Each graded task you perform is worth a certain number of points. These points will be converted to normalized points. All normalized points are equal.

Grade awarded will be mapped to the total number of normalized points earned as follows (instructor reserves the right to adjust this scale):

 - Weekly Status Reports | 50%
 - Mid-Term Reflection Paper | 20%
 - Final Reflection Paper | 30%

After the weighted average of the points is calculated, the following table shows the correspondence of scores to grade for the course: (The instructor reserves the right to adjust this scale.)

* Weekly Status Report: each individual need to create one status report each week due Friday evening. The first report is due to 04/19/2018.

**Check in your weekly report to your Github repository. Iâ€™ll check the reports and the timestamp of the reports for grading.**

Each report includes:

 - What have you completed since the last report?
   
 - What do you plan to complete by the next report?

 - What is getting in your way?
